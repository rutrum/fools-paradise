# Fool's Paradise

My submission for the WASM-4 Game Jam 2022.

## Ideas for Improvement

* enemies that shoot diagonally
* points for shooting enemies
* health
* shoot bullets
* background (parallax)
* powerups (spreader)
* add variety to bullet shots
* scores
* music enable/disable on main menu
* sound enable/disable on main menu
* logo

## Big feature idea: daynight cycle

* day is less intense, crimson theme, all powerups given here
* night is a short, high intensity round where say, the speed of everything is doubled.  You use the powerups from the daytime to survive
* requires abstraction of the color theme (not hard)
* an indication of "rounds"
